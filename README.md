# Clicky Game

The theme of my clicky game is cars. To play the game, just click on an image to begin. Each click earns you a point, but don't click the same image more than once or you lose.

The score and top score are recorded at the top. A message displays letting you know if your guess was correct or incorrect.

Simple animations make the game a little more interactive. Images that are hovered over enlarge. When you click an image, the size goes back to normal. If you guess incorrectly, the images shake.

Enjoy!
